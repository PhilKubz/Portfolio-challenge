## Description

The Project's goal is to create a working portfolio that may be updated and used at a future date for employment opportunities.

*Responsive Design* allows for users on any device to have a consistent experience when interacting with the website.

*Realistic use of skills* allows for a logical project that can showcase recently learned skills and combine them with prior knowledge.

The Challenge 02 Portfolio project includes work in both HTML and CSS to best layout the portfolio in appearance and functionality.

## Implementation

**Responsive design**
    - CSS flex propeties allow for adjustments to elements for a clean user interface.
    In this case, multiple flex wrap, and the inclusion with multiple elements allow for proper element arrangements.
    - Media queries also help with responsiveness allowing for certain elements to be altered based on screen sizes that are viewing the portfolio.
